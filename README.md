## COPD-PH Genetic Analysis Project

### Overview
Analyzing genetic and multi-omic signatures of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in COPD patients using COPDGene cohort data.

### Aims
1. Genetic analysis of PH in COPD
2. Multi-omics analysis of PH-related phenotypes
3. Validation of multi-omics risk score

### Methods
- Variant annotation (WGSA pipeline)
- Genetic association analysis (REGENIE)
- Multi-trait GWAS
- Multi-omics association analysis
- Survival analysis

### Data
- COPDGene cohort: >10,000 smokers
- Whole genome sequencing
- Detailed phenotyping

### Key Analyses
- PAH-associated genes in COPD smokers
- Carrier vs. non-carrier comparisons
- Multi-omics risk score development
- External cohort validation
